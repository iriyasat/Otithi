# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issue 1: Host Button Selection Problem in Registration
**Problem**: Users could select the Guest button but not the Host button during registration.

**Root Cause**: The JavaScript event handlers were using inline `onclick` attributes which were conflicting with the pointer-events: none CSS on the labels.

**Solution**:
1. Removed inline `onclick="selectHostType()"` and `onclick="selectGuestType()"` from the HTML
2. Added `data-type` attributes to user type cards for better identification
3. Updated JavaScript to use proper event delegation with `addEventListener`
4. Fixed the click event handling to work with both cards and radio buttons
5. Maintained backward compatibility with global functions

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/templates/auth/register.html` - Updated HTML structure and JavaScript

## Issue 2: Admin Login Redirect Problem
**Problem**: Admin login doesn't redirect to admin dashboard, stays on login page with 200 status.

**Root Cause**: The redirect chain admin login → main.dashboard → admin.dashboard may have issues with blueprint URL generation or route resolution.

**Solution**:
1. Added comprehensive debugging to auth login route
2. Added debugging to main dashboard route to track admin user flow
3. Added debugging to admin dashboard route to confirm successful access
4. Maintained the existing redirect chain but with better error handling and logging

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/routes/auth.py` - Enhanced debugging in login route
- `/app/routes/main.py` - Added debugging to dashboard route
- `/app/routes/admin.py` - Added debugging to admin dashboard route

## Testing Instructions

### Test Host Button Selection:
1. Go to `/register`
2. Try clicking both Guest and Host buttons
3. Verify both buttons become active and radio buttons are checked correctly
4. Submit form and verify user_type is correctly set

### Test Admin Login Redirect:
1. Login with admin credentials
2. Check terminal/console logs for debugging messages:
   - "DEBUG: Login successful for [admin_name] (admin)"
   - "DEBUG: Redirecting admin to admin.dashboard"
   - "DEBUG: Dashboard accessed by admin user: [admin_name]"
   - "DEBUG: Admin user detected, redirecting to admin.dashboard"
   - "DEBUG: Admin dashboard accessed by [admin_name]"
3. Verify successful redirect to `/admin/dashboard`
4. Verify admin dashboard loads with proper data

## Potential Additional Issues to Check

### If Host Button Still Doesn't Work:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify CSS pointer-events are not blocking clicks
- Check if Bootstrap or other CSS frameworks are interfering

### If Admin Redirect Still Fails:
- Check that admin blueprint is properly registered
- Verify admin user has correct user_type in database
- Check for any middleware or decorators blocking the redirect
- Verify admin.html template exists and loads correctly

## Debugging Commands

Check blueprint registration:
```python
from app import create_app
app = create_app()
print(app.url_map)
```

Check admin user in database:
```sql
SELECT id, full_name, email, user_type FROM users WHERE user_type = 'admin';
```
