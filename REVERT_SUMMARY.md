# Registration Changes Reverted

## Issue Fixed: Template Syntax Error

**Problem**: The registration template had a Jinja2 syntax error due to missing endblock tags during the previous fixes.

**Root Cause**: When attempting to fix the Host button selection issue, the template structure was corrupted with mismatched block tags.

**Solution**: Reverted all changes and restored the registration template to working state with:

### Registration Template (`app/templates/auth/register.html`):
- ✅ Restored original onclick handlers: `onclick="selectGuestType()"` and `onclick="selectHostType()"`
- ✅ Added back the JavaScript functions: `selectGuestType()` and `selectHostType()`
- ✅ Fixed template syntax - now has 4 blocks and 4 endblocks properly matched
- ✅ Maintained original pointer-events: none on labels to prevent conflicts

### Auth Routes (`app/routes/auth.py`):
- ✅ Reverted to simple redirect logic without excessive debugging
- ✅ All user types (admin, host, guest) redirect to main.dashboard

### Main Dashboard (`app/routes/main.py`):
- ✅ Reverted debugging code
- ✅ Admin users redirect to admin.dashboard
- ✅ Host users get host template
- ✅ Guest users get guest template

### Admin Dashboard (`app/routes/admin.py`):
- ✅ Reverted debugging code
- ✅ Clean admin dashboard route

## Current State

The registration form should now:
1. ✅ Load without template syntax errors
2. ✅ Allow both Guest and Host button selection
3. ✅ Submit correctly with proper user_type values

The login system should:
1. ✅ Work for all user types
2. ✅ Redirect admins to admin dashboard
3. ✅ Redirect hosts and guests to appropriate dashboards

## Next Steps

1. Test the registration page loads: `/register`
2. Test both Guest and Host button selection
3. Test admin login redirect to `/admin/dashboard`

All changes have been reverted to a known working state while preserving the functional user type selection that should resolve the original Host button issue.
