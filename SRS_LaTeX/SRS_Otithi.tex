\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
The tourism and hospitality industry in Bangladesh has experienced significant growth in recent years, with an increasing number of domestic and international travelers seeking alternative accommodation options beyond traditional hotels. The rise of the sharing economy globally has demonstrated the viability of peer-to-peer accommodation platforms, with services like Airbnb and Booking.com achieving massive success worldwide.

However, Bangladesh lacks a robust, localized vacation rental platform that addresses the specific needs of the local market, including support for Bangladeshi Taka, local payment methods, and cultural preferences. The existing international platforms often lack proper localization and fail to cater to the unique requirements of Bangladeshi hosts and guests.

\section{Motivation}
The development of Otithi is motivated by several key factors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The growing demand for alternative accommodation options in Bangladesh's expanding tourism sector
    \item The need for a platform that supports local payment methods and currency
    \item The opportunity to provide income generation for property owners across Bangladesh
    \item The requirement for a culturally appropriate and linguistically accessible platform
    \item The potential to boost domestic tourism and contribute to the local economy
    \item The gap in the market for a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly vacation rental platform
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem Statement}
Currently, the Bangladeshi vacation rental market faces several challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Lack of a centralized, trusted platform for vacation rentals
    \item Limited support for local payment methods and Bangladeshi Taka
    \item Absence of real-time booking and availability management systems
    \item Inadequate security measures for both hosts and guests
    \item Limited options for hosts to showcase their properties effectively
    \item Difficulty for travelers to find and book suitable accommodations
    \item Lack of standardized review and rating systems
    \item Absence of proper dispute resolution mechanisms
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives}
The primary objectives of the Otithi platform are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item To provide a seamless, intuitive experience for both hosts and guests
    \item To ensure secure, real-time booking and payment processing
    \item To support dynamic pricing with real-time availability updates
    \item To offer comprehensive property showcase capabilities with high-quality images
    \item To implement robust user management for admins, hosts, and guests
    \item To create a trusted environment through verified reviews and ratings
    \item To support multiple languages (Bengali and English) for accessibility
    \item To integrate local payment methods and currency support
    \item To establish a scalable platform that can grow with market demands
    \item To contribute to the growth of Bangladesh's tourism industry
\end{itemize}

\chapter{System Overview}

Otithi is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed specifically for the Bangladeshi vacation rental market. The platform serves as a digital marketplace connecting property owners (hosts) with travelers (guests) seeking short-term accommodation.

The system architecture follows a modern three-tier approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Presentation Layer: Responsive web interface built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap framework
    \item Business Logic Layer: Python-based backend using Flask framework for API development and business rule implementation
    \item Data Layer: MySQL database for persistent data storage with optimized queries and indexing
\end{itemize}

Key system components include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User authentication and authorization system
    \item Property listing management module
    \item Search and booking engine

    \item Review and rating system
    \item Administrative dashboard
    \item Notification and communication system
    \item Image upload and gallery management
    \item Real-time availability and pricing calculator
\end{itemize}

The platform supports three distinct user roles: Guests (travelers seeking accommodation), Hosts (property owners), and Administrators (system managers), each with specific functionalities and access levels.
