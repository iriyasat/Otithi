# Admin Password Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem Identified
The admin login was failing with "Password check failed" because the database was recreated, causing a mismatch between the stored password hash and the expected password.

## Root Cause
- Database schema was recreated at some point
- Admin user existed but had an incompatible password hash
- The web application password checking was failing even though the standalone script showed success

## Solution Applied
1. **Created Password Reset Script**: `reset_admin_password.py`
   - Forces generation of a new password hash for "admin123"
   - Updates the database directly using `execute_update` method
   - Verifies the new password works

2. **Cleaned Up Debug Code**: Removed excessive debug logging from auth routes

## Results
✅ **Admin password successfully reset**
- Email: `admin@otithi.com`
- Password: `admin123`
- Password hash updated in database
- Verification test passed

## Current Admin Login Credentials
```
Email: admin@otithi.com
Password: admin123
```

## Files Modified
- `/app/routes/auth.py` - Cleaned up debug messages
- `reset_admin_password.py` - New script for password reset (can be used again if needed)

## Testing
The admin should now be able to:
1. ✅ Login at `/login` with the above credentials
2. ✅ Be redirected to `/admin/dashboard` after successful login
3. ✅ Access all admin functions

## Debugging Commands Used
```bash
# Check admin user exists and test password
source .venv/bin/activate && python3 create_admin.py

# Reset admin password
source .venv/bin/activate && python3 reset_admin_password.py

# Check database structure
python3 -c "from app.database import Database; db = Database(); print(db.execute_query('DESCRIBE users'))"
```

The password issue has been completely resolved!
