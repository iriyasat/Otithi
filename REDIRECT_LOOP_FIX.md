# Redirect Loop Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The redirect loop was caused by **conflicting route definitions** for `/login` and `/register` between multiple blueprints:

1. **Auth Blueprint** (`auth.py`) - ✅ Correct location
2. **Legacy Routes** (`legacy_routes.py`) - ❌ **CONFLICTING** (now removed)
3. **Main Blueprint** (`main.py`) - ✅ No conflicts (redirect routes already removed)

## Root Cause
Both the blueprint system AND the legacy routes system were registering simultaneously, causing Flask to encounter multiple route handlers for the same URLs (`/login` and `/register`), resulting in infinite 302 redirects.

## Fix Applied ✅

### 1. Removed Conflicting Routes
- **Deleted `/login` route from `legacy_routes.py`** (lines ~779-819)
- **Deleted `/register` route from `legacy_routes.py`** (lines ~821-957) 
- **Deleted `/logout` route from `legacy_routes.py`** (line ~960)

### 2. Verified Clean Separation
- **Auth Blueprint**: Handles `/login`, `/register`, `/logout` ✅
- **Legacy Routes**: No auth routes (fallback system only) ✅
- **Main Blueprint**: No auth route conflicts ✅

## Current Route Structure ✅

```
Auth Routes (auth_bp):
├── /login (GET, POST)
├── /register (GET, POST)
└── /logout (GET)

Main Routes (main_bp):
├── / (homepage)
├── /dashboard
├── /profile
├── /my-bookings
├── /my-listings
└── /logout → redirect to auth.logout

Admin Routes (admin_bp):
└── /admin/* (all admin functionality)

Legacy Routes (fallback only):
├── / (homepage - fallback)
├── /dashboard (fallback)
├── /profile (fallback)
└── Other non-auth routes
```

## Testing Verification

### Before Fix:
```
INFO:werkzeug:127.0.0.1 - - [02/Aug/2025 17:53:50] "GET /login HTTP/1.1" 302 -
INFO:werkzeug:127.0.0.1 - - [02/Aug/2025 17:53:50] "GET /login HTTP/1.1" 302 -
INFO:werkzeug:127.0.0.1 - - [02/Aug/2025 17:53:50] "GET /login HTTP/1.1" 302 -
[...infinite loop...]
```

### After Fix:
- `/login` should now load properly without redirects
- `/register` should now load properly without redirects
- Auth flow should work correctly

## Blueprint Registration Logic ✅

The app initialization follows this logic:
1. **Try to register blueprints** → If successful, use blueprint system
2. **If blueprints fail** → Fall back to legacy_routes.py
3. **If legacy fails** → Use basic hardcoded routes

Since we removed conflicting routes from legacy_routes.py, both systems can now coexist safely if needed.

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Test login page**: Visit `/login` - should load without redirect loop
2. **Test register page**: Visit `/register` - should load without redirect loop  
3. **Test auth flow**: Try logging in with valid credentials
4. **Test admin access**: Login as admin and access `/admin/dashboard`
5. **Verify blueprint registration**: Check startup logs for successful blueprint registration
